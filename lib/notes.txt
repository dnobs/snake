- main screen should have a square box that is the parent of individual cells
    - how do we make sure it's a square?
    - aspect ratio!

- implementation:
    - controls: don't care, but make it changeable
    - snake & grid:
        - snake is subclass of grid cell
        - maybe I don't even need to keep a grid cell?? yeah I don't think I need to...
